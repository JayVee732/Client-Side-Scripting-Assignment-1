Client	Side	Scripting	2	
Assignment	1	–	20%	Due	Date:	Sunday,	February	19th	at	22:00	
via	Moodle	and	Turnitin	

Submission:	Use	the	Week	4	Moodle	link	“Assignment	1”	to	upload	a	single	zip	file	which	will	contain	everything	I	need	to	test your	assignment	(HTML	files	etc.).	There	is	an	upload	limit	of	50MB.	Make	sure	when	I	extract	the	zip	file	the	paths	are	correct.		

Use	the	week	4	Moodle	link	“Assignment	1	–	Turnitin”	to	upload	all	of	your	code	in	a	single	word	document.	This	includes	JavaScript,	CSS,	HTML	and	any	other	documentation.		

Part	A	–	40%	
Write	a	piece	of	code	which	will	take	in	book	data	for	a	library	via	an	appropriately	styled	HTML	form.	The	specific	data	is	to	be	decided	by	yourself	but	would	obviously	include	book	name,	publisher	and	ISBN.	Have	a	button	called	“Store”	which	should	store	the	book	to	local	storage.	If	other	books	have	already	been	stored	this	book	should	be	appended	to that	list.	Call	the	HTML	file	“bookstore.htm”.	Data	should	be	stored	in	such	a	fashion	as	to	allow	for	use	by	other	applications	if	required	(i.e.	JSON).	Have	a	second	HTML	file	called	“bookRetrieve.htm”	which	will	load	all	books	currently	stored	in	local	storage	(again,	appropriately	styled).	A	“Clear	Storage”	button	should	also	be	included	which	will	clear	all	local	storage.	(20%)		

On	the	“bookRetrieve.htm”	page	have	a	mechanism	for	deleting	one	or	more	books	such	that	local	storage	will	be	updated	so	as	not	to	include	any	deleted	books.	(10%).	Be	able	to	delete	a	book	by	at	least	two	options	(10%).		

Part	B	–	50%	
Write	a	piece	of	HTML5	(“Shapes.htm”)	which	takes	in	enough	coordinates	(and	any	other	information)	to	allow	you	to	create	a	shape	via	the	HTML5	canvas.	The	actual	shape	is	to	be	decided	by	yourself	(you	can	make	up	your	own).	Higher	marks	are	available	for	more	complex	shapes.	When	the	coordinates/details	are	taken	in	they	are	to	be	stored	to	local	storage.	Create	a	second	HTML	page	(“Render.htm”)	which	will	dynamically	render	the	shape	by	reading	the	storage.	(35%)		

Also	have	on	the	page	a	styled	rectangular	div.	When	the	shape	is	dropped	into	the	div	a	sound	should	play	and	both	the	shape	and	div	should	be	removed	from	the	page	DOM,	and	storage	should	be	cleared.	(15%)		

Part	C	–	10%	
Create	a	unique	jQuery	animation.	In	the	code	documentation,	explain	why	you	believe	it	to	be	unique.
